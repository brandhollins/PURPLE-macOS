## Development Journey 🛠️

The creation of Purple was driven by my vision to simplify complex file management tasks on MacOS. As a solo developer, I faced several challenges, primarily in performance optimization and AI integration. Ensuring smooth operation while handling large file operations proved particularly demanding, as did implementing accurate and efficient AI algorithms for file categorization and image upscaling.

User experience design presented another significant hurdle. I aimed to strike a delicate balance between powerful features and an intuitive interface, ensuring Purple remained accessible to users of all technical levels.

To overcome these challenges, I implemented several key solutions:

• Leveraged SwiftUI for a responsive and native MacOS experience
• Integrated SwiftData for robust data management and persistence
• Utilized multi-threading to handle resource-intensive tasks without compromising UI responsiveness

My development approach centered on creating a modular architecture, allowing for easy feature additions and maintenance. This strategy not only facilitated smoother development but also laid the groundwork for future expansions and improvements.

Throughout the process, I remained committed to my core goal: creating a tool that genuinely enhances productivity and simplifies digital organization for MacOS users. The result is Purple – a testament to the power of combining cutting-edge technology with user-centric design.
